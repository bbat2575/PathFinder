# PathFinder

**Uses breadth first search algorithm to check if a path exists between two vertices.**

Given a .in file representing an undirected graph, check if a path exists between a pair of vertices (called 'queries').

A .in file contains graph information in the following order:
1. Number of vertices
1. Number of edges
1. Edges - Starting vertex, ending vertex, and edge weight (edge weight is ignored!)
1. Number of queries
1. Queries

## Example

For *graph8.in*:

8           <- Number of vertices  
7           <- Number of edges  
0 1 0.802   <- Egdes  
0 5 0.937   ...  
0 7 0.019   ...  
1 5 0.233   ...  
2 3 0.154   ...  
3 4 0.651   ...  
6 7 0.010   ...  
8           <- Number of queries  
2 3         <- Queries  
5 2         ...  
2 1         ...  
2 4         ...  
7 0         ...  
7 1         ...  
1 4         ...  
5 7         ...
